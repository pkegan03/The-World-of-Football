    <p class="center">
        Football is made up of several primary positions that work together to move the ball,
        defend the field, and score points. Below are the main positions you'll see in most games.
    </p>
    <br>

    <h2>Offensive Positions</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Quarterback (QB): The leader of the offense who throws passes, hands off the ball, and calls plays.</li>
    <li>Running Back (RB): Runs the ball, catches passes, and helps block defenders.</li>
    <li>Wide Receiver (WR): Specializes in catching passes and gaining big yards down the field.</li>
    <li>Tight End (TE): A hybrid player who can block like a lineman and catch like a receiver.</li>
    <li>Offensive Linemen (OL): Protect the quarterback and create running lanes. Includes Centers, Guards, and Tackles.</li>
</ul>
<br>

<h2>Defensive Positions</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Defensive Linemen (DL): Rush the quarterback and stop running plays. Includes Ends and Tackles.</li>
    <li>Linebacker (LB): Versatile players who defend the run, cover receivers, and blitz the quarterback.</li>
    <li>Cornerback (CB): Covers wide receivers and works to stop passing plays.</li>
    <li>Safety (S): The last line of defense, helping prevent big plays and covering deep passes.</li>
</ul>
<br>

<h2>Special Teams Positions</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Kicker (K): Kicks field goals and extra points.</li>
    <li>Punter (P): Kicks the ball away on fourth down to shift field position.</li>
    <li>Returner (KR/PR): Returns kickoffs and punts to gain field position.</li>
</ul>
<br>

    <p>
        These positions form the core structure of a football team. Each player has a specialized role
        that contributes to the overall strategy and success of the team.
