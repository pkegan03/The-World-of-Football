            This is the main content area of the layout page. You can write about basketball rules,
            famous players, court positions, or anything your assignment wants. The left menu and
            right menu sit on each side, and this section stays in the middle.

            In basketball, two teams try to score by shooting the ball through the hoop. Players move
            the ball by dribbling and passing, and each team plays both offense and defense. It’s a
            fast-paced sport that requires speed, teamwork, and good decision-making.
